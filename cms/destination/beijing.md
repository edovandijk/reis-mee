      The line patterns on the vast surface of the CCTV tower reflect the forces
      of gravity on the inner structure of the building; the more lines, the
      bigger the force.

One week in the capital of China, Beijing. Tiananmen Square, the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, 798 Art District, and various other parts of this wonderful city. And we cycled to the Great Wall of China and walked a lesser known stretch of the wall, without the hurds of tourists which you typically encounter on the most visited parts of the wall in the greater Beijing area. Again, a wonderful experience that makes us want to see more of this incredible country.
