      The Tokaido Shinkansen (Tokyo - Nagoya - Kyoto - Osaka) is the oldest of
      the Shinkansen network. Running at up to 320 km/h, the Shinkansen is known
      for punctuality: most trains depart on time to the second.

      Kiyomizu-dera (literally meaning "Pure Water Temple") is one of the most
      celebrated temples of Japan. It was founded in 780 on the site of the
      Otowa Waterfall in the wooded hills east of Kyoto.

      Although kimonos are no longer everyday wear in Japan, people still like
      to wear them at various times throughout the year. And when they do, they
      use the fabrics, colors, and designs of their kimonos to express their
      love of the seasons.

      Kiyomizu-dera is best known for its wooden stage that juts out from its
      main hall, 13 meters above the hillside below. The main hall and the stage
      were built without the use of a single nail.

      Nijo castle, back in Kyoto. Or to be more precise, the entrance to the
      Ninomaru palace. A beautiful shogun place but we were not allowed to
      photograph inside.

      This is not intended as a piece of art, but as protection against the
      cold. There is a fir tree in there. Amazing! So much nicer than bubble
      plastic!

      Don't know what they are. The girl can't be a Maiko (apprentice geisha)
      because they are not admitted before they are 15 years old. Pretty picture
      though...

We visited Edo's uncle Hans and Hiromi in Fukuoka and then traveled with Hans for a week through the Kyushu peninsula, visiting places like Nagasaki, Kumamoto, and Dazaifu. After a week traveling together, we said goodbye to Hans & Hiromi and took a bullet train to Kyoto and Nara to see the amazing historical sites there in the gorgeous autumn colours.
