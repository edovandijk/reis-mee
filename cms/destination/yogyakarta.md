      We woke up very early in the morning to go and see the sunrise over the
      temple complex.

      Unfortunately, the horizon was shrouded in clouds so we didn't see the

      Built in the 9th century the temple was designed in Javanese Buddhist
      architecture, which blends the Indonesian indigenous cult of ancestor
      worship and the Buddhist concept of attaining Nirvana.

      The monument is both a shrine to Buddha and a place for Buddhist
      pilgrimage. The journey for pilgrims begins at the base, follows a path
      around the monument and ascends to the top through the three levels
      symbolic of Buddhist cosmology.

      Worldwide knowledge of Borobudur's existence was sparked in 1814 by Sir
      Thomas Stamford Raffles, then the British ruler of Java, who was advised
      of its location by native Indonesians.

      On an inspection tour to Semarang in 1814, Raffles was informed about a
      big monument deep in a jungle near the village of Bumisegoro.

      Raffles was not able to make the discovery himself and sent H.C.
      Cornelius, a Dutch engineer, to investigate.

      In two months, Cornelius and his 200 men cut down trees, burned down
      vegetation and dug away the earth to reveal the monument.

      The beauty of this part of the trip is in the journey through the
      mountains and rice fields, not the destination. Candi Selogriyo is small
      and little noteworthy after having seen the large temples in the valley.

      In December 1998, the temple was destroyed by a landslide. The

      The Kraton palace is the main seat of the Sultan of Yogyakarta and his
      family. It serves as a cultural center for the Javanese people and
      contains a museum that displays the sultanate's artifacts.

      The Kraton was built by Prince Mangkubumi in 1755-1756, several months
      after the signing of the Treaty of Giyanti between Prince Mangkubumi of
      Yogyakarta, Hamengkubuwono of Surakarta and the Dutch East India Company.

A short trip to the former king's city Yogyakarta on Central Java between Christmas and New Year's Eve 2016 to see the town, but more specifically the old temple complexes such as the Borobudur, Sumur Gumuling, Prambanan, Candi Plaosan, and the rice terraces in the neighbourhood.
